# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn about implementing Recurrent Neural Network in TensorFlow. 
RNN's charactristics makes it suitable for many different tasks; from simple classification to machine translation, language modelling, sentiment analysis, etc.

In this series of tutorials, we'll start with using a vanilla RNN for classifying MNIST digits. 
Then we'll switch to its more complicated versions, namely LSTM which helps getting better performances.
