    "In this tutorial, we'll create a simple neural network classifier in TensorFlow. The key advantage of this model over the [Linear Classifier](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/3_Neural_Network/Tutorials/1_Neural_Network.ipynb) trained in the previous tutorial is that it can separate data which is __NOT__ linearly separable. We will implement this model for classifying images of hand-written digits from the so-called MNIST data-set.\n",

    "We assume that you have the basic knowledge over the concept and you are just interested in the __Tensorflow__ implementation of the Neural Nets.

The implemented network has 2 hidden layers: the first one with 200 hidden units (neurons) and the second one (also known as classifier layer) with 10 (number of classes) neurons.\n",
