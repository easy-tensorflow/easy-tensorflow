============
Motivation
============

There is a necessity to address the motivations for this project. TensorFlow is one of the deep learning frameworks available with the largest community.
This repository is dedicated to suggesting a simple path to learn TensorFlow.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why use TensorFlow?

We can summarize the **pros** as below:

    - It’s developed and maintained by Google. As such, a continued support and development is ensured
    - Very large and active community
    - Low-level and high-level interfaces to network training
    - Tensorboard is the powerful visualization suite which is developed to track both the network topology and performance, making debugging even simpler.
    - Written in Python (even though some parts crucial for performance is implemented in C++) which is a very attractive language to read and develop in
    - Multiple GPUs support. So you can freely run the code on different machines without having to stop or restart the program
    - Faster model compilation than Theano-based options
    - Faster compile times than Theano
    - Is about more than deep learning. TensorFlow actually has tools to support reinforcement learning and other algorithms.

In addition to the aforementioned points, the large community of TensorFlow enrich the developers with the answer to almost all the
questions one may encounter. Furthermore, since most of the developers are using TensorFlow for code development, having a hands-on on TensorFlow is a necessity these days.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why this repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most of the available projects on the web, one of the below issues exists:

 - There is no or very limited explanation of what is happening in the code.
 - Different parts are not connected in a meaningful way.
 - The code implementation is too vague or complicated.
 - The focus is on either advanced or elementary level of Tensorflow implementation.

In this project, we tried to connect parts from easy to advanced with detailed tutorials while keeping the code implementation
as simple as possible.

=================================================
TensorFlow Installation and Setup the Environment
=================================================


The aim here is to explain how to install TensorFlow library "step by step" and on
different operating systems. TensorFlow is a python library. Similar to many others, we tried
installing many side packages and libraries and experienced lots of problems and errors.

In order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:
