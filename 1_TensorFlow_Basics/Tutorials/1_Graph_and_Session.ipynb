    "\n",
    "__Part 1:__ building the __GRAPH__, it represents the data flow of the computations\n",
    "\n",
    "__Part 2:__ running a __SESSION__, it executes the operations in the graph\n",

    "First step you create the graph i.e. what you want to do with the data, then you run it seperately using a session (don't struggle to wrap your head around it, it will come to you eventually). \n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: When you create a graph, you are not bound to run the whole graph and can control the parts of the graph that are executed separately. This provides a huge flexibility with your models. \n",

Hence, TensorFlow is simply referring to the flow of the Tensors in the computational graph.\n",

    "## GRAPH\n",
    "The biggest idea about Tensorflow is that all the numerical computations are expressed as a computational graph. In other words, the backbone of any Tensorflow program is a __Graph__. Anything that happens in your model is represented by the computational graph. This makes it, the to go place for anything related to your model. Quoted from the TensorFlow website, \"A __computational graph__ (or graph in short) is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes\". Basically, it means a graph is just an arrangement of nodes that represent the operations in your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So First let's see what does a node and operation mean? The best way to explain it is by looking at a simple example. Suppose we want to write the code for function $f(x,y)=x^2y+y+2$. The Graph in TensorFlow will be something like:\n",

    "\n",
    "The graph is composed of a series of nodes connected to each other by edges (from the image above). Each __node__ in the graph is called __op__ (short for operation). So we'll have one node for each operation; either for operations on tensors (like math operations) or generating tensors (like variables and constants). Each node takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces a tensor as an output.\n",

    "Let's start with a basic arithmatic operation like addition to demonstrate a graph. The code adds two values, say a=2 and b=3, using TensorFlow. To do so, we need to call __tf.add()__. From here on, we recommend you to check out the documentation of each method/class to get a clear idea of what it can do(documentation can be found at tensorflow.org or you can just use google to get to the required page in the documentation). The __tf.add()__ has three arugments 'x', 'y', and 'name' where x and y are the values to be added together and __name__ is the operation name, i.e. the name associated to the addition node on the graph.\n",

When we print out the variable __c__ (i.e. the output Tensor of the addition operation), it prints out the Tensor information; its name (Add), shape (__()__ means scalar), and type (32-bit integer). However, It does not spit out the result (2+3=5). Why?!\n",

    "Remember earlier in this post, we talked about the two parts of a TensorFlow code. First step is to create a graph and to actually evaluate the nodes, we must run the computational graph within a __Session__. In simple words, the written code only generates the graph which only determines the expected sizes of Tensors and operations to be executed on them. However, it doesn't assign a numeric value to any of the Tensors i.e. TensorFlow does not execute the graph unless it is specified to do so with a session. Hence, to assign these values and make them flow through the graph, we need to create and run a session.\n",
