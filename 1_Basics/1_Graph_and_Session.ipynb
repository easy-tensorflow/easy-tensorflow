Anything that happens in your model is represented by the computational graph. This makes it, the to go place for anything related to your model. Quoted from the TensorFlow website, \"A __computational graph__ (or graph in short) is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes\". Basically, it means a graph is just an arrangement of nodes that represent the operations in your model. \n",

    "The graph is composed of a series of nodes connected to each other by edges (from the image above). Each __node__ in the graph is called __op__ (short for operation). So we'll have one node for each operation; either for operations on tensors (like math operations) or generating tensors (like variables and constants). Each node takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces a tensor as an output.\n",

From here on, we recommend you to check out the documentation of each method/class to get a clear idea of what it can do(documentation can be found at tensorflow.org or you can just use google to get to the required page in the documentation). The __tf.add()__ has three arugments 'x', 'y', and 'name' where x and y are the values to be added together and __name__ is the operation name, i.e. the name associated to the addition node on the graph.\n",

However, it doesn't assign a numeric value to any of the Tensors i.e. TensorFlow does not execute the graph unless it is specified to do so with a session.
