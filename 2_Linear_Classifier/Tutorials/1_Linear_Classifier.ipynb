    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we use the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits. If you are into machine learning, you might have heard of this dataset by now. MNIST is kind of benchmark of datasets for deep learning and is easily accesible through Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains $55,000$ examples for training, $5,000$ examples for validation and $10,000$ examples for testing. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image ($28\\times28$ pixels) with values from $0$ to $1$. For simplicity, each image has been flattened and converted to a 1-D numpy array of $784$ features ($28\\times28$).\n",

    "### 1.1. Data dimension\n",
    "Here, we specify the dimensions of the images which will be used in several places in the code below. Defining these variables makes it easier (compared with using hard-coded number all throughout the code) to modify them later. Ideally these would be inferred from the data that has been read, but here we will just write the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that in a linear model, we have to flatten the input images into a vector. Here, each of the $28\\times28$ images are flattened into a $1\\times784$ vector. "
